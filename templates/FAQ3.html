	<h3>About mRNA COVID-19 vaccines</h3>
	<ul style="margin:0; margin-left: 25px; padding:0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color:#495055; font-size:16px; line-height:22px;" align="left" type="disc">
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines are designed to produce an immune response that protects us against the virus that causes COVID-19. 
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			The two currently authorized COVID-19 mRNA vaccines available in Ontario are the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.  
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	<h3>How do mRNA vaccines work</h3>
	<ul style="margin:0; margin-left: 25px; padding:0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color:#495055; font-size:16px; line-height:22px;" align="left" type="disc">
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			The vaccine works by delivering genetic instructions, mRNA, to our cells to produce a copy of   a protein that is found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus.  
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			These viral proteins, known as antigens, are recognized by the body which starts  an immune response.  
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			The vaccine does not give you the virus or cause an infection. After our cells make copies  of the protein, they destroy the mRNA from the vaccine.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>mRNA vaccines are safe and effective</h3>
	<ul style="margin:0; margin-left: 25px; padding:0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color:#495055; font-size:16px; line-height:22px;" align="left" type="disc">
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			The mRNA vaccines were authorized by Health Canada after they were shown to be safe, effective and of high quality in clinical trials   with 70,000 people. 
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			In clinical trials, the mRNA vaccines were more than 94% effective  in preventing COVID-19 among people who had received two doses.
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			The vaccines cannot give you COVID-19.  
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			The vaccines do not interfere with COVID-19 test results used to look for infection and do not give false positive test results.  
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			More research is being done to determine how long the vaccine protection lasts and if it will prevent others around you from getting sick with COVID-19. 
		</li>
		
	</ul>

	<h3>Like every vaccine, there may be possible side effects</h3>
	<ul style="margin:0; margin-left: 25px; padding:0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color:#495055; font-size:16px; line-height:22px;" align="left" type="disc">
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			The most common side effects are pain at the injection site, fatigue and a headache.  
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			Other common side effects can include: fever, chills, muscle pain and joint pain.  
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			These side effects usually occur within 1-2 days after vaccination and go away within 1-3 days.  
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			Until vaccines are widely available, it is important to continue to protect yourself and those around you from COVID-19.  
		</li>
		<li class="Misc-Font-Color-2">
			Keep practicing protective measures such as washing your hands, physical distancing, covering your mouth when you cough, wearing a mask and following local public health guidance.  
		</li>
